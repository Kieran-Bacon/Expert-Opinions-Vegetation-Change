# Expert-Opinions-Vegetation-Change
The size of climate model ensembles is vast and ever growing it is clear that it is becoming increasingly necessary to create automated tools to analyse this data. This report details the development process of a comprehensive platform to facilitate this analysis by constructing complex representations of climate experts via multiple machine learning techniques. These Expert models are used to evaluate vegetation outputs generated from the current Perturbed Physics ensemble models. Through the development, Gradient boosted trees combined with principal component analysis has shown to be the best at representing climate experts. This whole system has been structured in the form of a maintainable, scalable, and extendable web tool, aiming to be a catalyst for future development in this field.
